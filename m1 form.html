      <p> a)Students were asked to rate the food in the cafeteria
	  on a scale of 1 to 10. Use a meter element with text to
	  its left and right to indicate that the average rating 
	  was 7 out of 10.</p>

      0 <meter min="0"
	 max = "10"
	 value= "7" /></meter> 10

      <p> b) Create a details element that displays the summary 
	  text "Survey Results" for Part (a).When the user clicks
	  the arrow next to the summary text, an explanatory paragraph
	  about the survey should be displayed. </p>

      <details>
	  <summary>Survey Results</summary>
	  <ul>
		<li>"On average, students rated the cafeteria food on 
	 	     a scale of 1 to 10. On average, students rated the food a 7."</li>
	  </ul></details>

      <p> c) Create a text input element for a first name. The element
	  should automatically receive the focus when the form is rendered
	  in a browser.</p>

      <p><label>First Name:
	 <input type = "text" autofocus /> (first name) </label> </p>

      <p> d) Modify Part (c) to eliminate the label element and use placeholder 
	     text in the input element.</p>
	  <input type = "text" placeholder = "first name"/>

      <p> e) Use a datalist to provide an autocomplete list for five states. </p>
      
      <input type = "text" placeholder = "Select a State" list = "states" />
      <datalist id = "states">
	<option value = "Florida">
        <option value = "Ohio">
        <option value = "Utah">
        <option value = "California">
        <option value = "Wyoming">
      </datalist>
      
     <p> f) Create a range input element that allows the user to select a number from 1 to 100.</p> 
	
     <label> Range from 1 - 100: 
	0 <input type = "range"
	 min = "0"
	 max = "100"
	 value = "50" /> 100
	</label>
     
     <p>g) Specify that autocomplete should not be allowed for a form. Show only the form’s opening tag. </p>

     <form method = "post" autocomplete "off">
	<p> <label> First name:
	   <input type = "text" placeholder = "first name" />
	</label></p>	

     <p>h) Use a mark element to highlight the second sentence in the following paragraph.</p>
	 
	<p>Students were asked to rate the food in the cafeteria on a scale of 1 to 10. 
	<mark>The average result was 7.</mark></p>
